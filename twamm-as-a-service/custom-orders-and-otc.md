# Custom Orders & OTC

For custom orders and OTC, reach out team members on [telegram or discord](../links/links.md).

Custom orders and OTC remains permissionless / non-custodial, therefore there are no middleman risks.

Here are services that we offer for custom orders and OTC.

### **Custom Fees**

For larger trades (generally $500k <), LP Finance might offer custom fee options depending on the token pair and market conditions.

### Custom Execution Period

Different tokens have different market liquidity available on-chain. However, our public service restricts maximum execution period to 1 week.

As this period might not be suitable for certain strategies / trading size, LP Finance offers custom execution period for qualified traders.

### Custom Tokens

Due to different demands on different tokens, we cannot host all tokens available on LP Finance TWAMM. Traders can request an order for custom tokens (not available on UI) for specific needs.

### OTC Trading

LP Finance TWAMM has an internal matching system, which does not route through external liquidity pools, reducing swap fees.

If trader submits an OTC trade, LP Finance could assist in searching for counterparties that are willing to OTC trade at any pre-determined price or dynamic price without slippage.

If using dynamic price, remaining amount of one party could be traded on market.
