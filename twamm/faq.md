# FAQ

1. **Why is the order not being filled frequently?**

Orders are normally filled by cranks, which matches orders internally or execute swap on Jupiter. If there are no counterparties and the order execution amount is too small, cranks would skip the order until it can be executed via Jupiter.&#x20;

2. **Why is there a smal portion of USDC left after order is complete?**

As some AMMs leave dusts on input if the decimals of input and output token is different, small portion (â‰ˆ0.00001 USDC) could be left as dust.
